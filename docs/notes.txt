- Made the following change in config/view.php, to re-route angular view requests to public/views:
    'paths' => [
        public_path('views')
    ],

- JS libs installed via npm are currently kept in public/js/node_modules.
  This is not the best place, as it's publicly visible.
  Furthermore, we are using the non-minified versions of all JS libs, which is also not ideal.

- Account Verification: currently only supports manual verification code entry. Could be
  extended to have a link in the mail that does the verification automatically on being followed.

- SSL: currently does not use SSL. Should change to using SSL in the future, to avoid sending passwords in clear

- Authentication: we currently send the user ID along with all authenticated requests. However, this should not be
  necessary - the "API key" should be all that's necessary for the back-end to identify the user

- Logging all uncaught exceptions would help debug error conditions, in production

- Laravel maintains a PHP session, by default, via session cookie. We should turn this off, because the API provides
  session management. Must check how it can be turned off and what the consequences would be.

- The datetime handling in the API authentication code could be subject to timezone issues. We should ensure that
  we create all datetime values as UTC.

- Currently, datetime values are formatted Date.toUTCString(), in the UI. This should probably be configurable
  somewhere, maybe with the default guessed from the browser's locale, or something.
  Either way. it would be helpful to use a Date library like moment.js, for easier formatting and parsing of dates.

- The users endpoint (UserController) currently provides functionality for 2 concepts:
    1. User
    2. Session
  We should split this up into two separate endpoints (and 2 separate controllers). This would make the code a little
  cleaner and keep concerns separated.
